# 3D-rendering
Rendering 3D models using ray-tracer via C++

Description:

1. Built 3D models from given OBJ file(teapot)
2. Implemented my own algorithms to realize the features

Features include:
1. Anti aliasing by shooting multiple rays to each pixel
2. Global illumination and ambient occulusion
3. Refraction for the crystal teapot
4. Reflection and environment mapping
5. Soft shadow under multiple light sources.
6. Caustic.
7. Texture mapping and bump mapping.
8. Point light, Spot light, area light.
9. Depth field blur.
